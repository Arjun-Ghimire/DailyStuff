We see success of peoples but we never see the hardwork behind, we usually say " He/she is soo talented " but we never see how that person become talented how hardworking
the person is... This is a big myth no one is born talented everything is because of there hardwork and perseverance.. Mightbe someone has a strong gene but at last 
hardwork matters the most.. For example see this = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAzlWScHTc4 here the actor must have done soo much of hardwork to dance the steps
we just enjoy watching the videos but we never see the hardwork and the number of times they failed while practising they might have taken hundreds of retakes 😂
Life is hard, we should learn to crack all difficulties. I am myself not very hardworking but I am learning tho :) So I am no one to give advice but this is my random 
feeling and no one is telling you to read this by the way... you came here yourself* But no one reads this I am stupid haha talking to myself lol 😂😂
