Shit lol🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I left my maths class and came to library to figure out the problem on my code why it wasn't working and at last it was a problem of browser lol 😂
It was because of cache in browser that was doing the wrong calculation and showing wrong value on comipiling. Finally I figured it out and its solved now.
From the morning I spend my time thinking about the data flow why it wasn't working but at last it was a problem with browser cache lol 😂😂😂😂

I left my college and came to home because I was having super headache and having many hairfalls 🥹
When I start to focus on something I focus too much even my dream, my concentration everything everytime is onto that one thing 😕😕
I should control this and I will start working on this. I mean I will try to learn to be focused without affecting my body 😕

Another thing, since I am developing an AI technology so for this I need to be very strong on maths. Thats why from today to next 1 week I will completely keep my main priority to maths

Feeling lonely today and I have no one to talk :(

// 7:11 Pm
Just now I helped a person, he says he is a student and he left bag or something and he says he don't have money to return back home and he requested me to lend money and I give him money he asked me for i.e rs 150 
And I told him no need to return money you can keep the money :)

I helped him with money but I feel like he is a scammer 😂 His getup and scars and seems like he came after fighting with someone.. any way I helped him because I feel like if that is real then he is on problem so I helped him.
By the way I am on road and typing lol I am closing my phone now.!
