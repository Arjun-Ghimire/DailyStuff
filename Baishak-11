Shit lolğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ I left my maths class and came to library to figure out the problem on my code why it wasn't working and at last it was a problem of browser lol ğŸ˜‚
It was because of cache in browser that was doing the wrong calculation and showing wrong value on comipiling. Finally I figured it out and its solved now.
From the morning I spend my time thinking about the data flow why it wasn't working but at last it was a problem with browser cache lol ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚
