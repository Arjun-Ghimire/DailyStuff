Just wakeup

// 4:58 Am
Studied differential eqn 1st order solved few questions for 2 hours.
I am not just studying, I am understanding the concepts!

// 10:44 AM
I am continious working on to understand ordinary diff equation and I just checked I already did 63 pages of practice in between
today and yesterday only wow nice ğŸ˜‚ Hopefully it will cross 100+ pages by the end of today!

I don't care page, I should understand everything that is what matters!

haha I studied the differential equation of love ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ that is very funny lol ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚
the equation is -

d(love_girl) / dt = love_boy ... (i)

d(love_boy) / dt = love_girl ... (ii)

Means when a boy keeps flirting with girl then the feeling of girl decreases with time according to eqn 1 
and when a boy starts to focus on other things then the feeling of girl starts to increase with time according to eqn 2 ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£

lol this equation of love looks very funny and interesting ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ but is it true lol ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚
