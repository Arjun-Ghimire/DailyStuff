Just wakeup

// 4:58 Am
Studied differential eqn 1st order solved few questions for 2 hours.
I am not just studying, I am understanding the concepts!

// 10:44 AM
I am continious working on to understand ordinary diff equation and I just checked I already did 63 pages of practice in between
today and yesterday only wow nice ðŸ˜‚ Hopefully it will cross 100+ pages by the end of today!

I don't care page, I should understand everything that is what matters!

haha I studied the differential equation of love ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ that is very funny lol ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
the equation is -

d(love1) / dt = a(love2) ... (i)

d(love2) / dt = - b(love1) ... (ii)


[ first possibily ]
Means when a boy keeps flirting with girl then the feeling of girl decreases with time according to eqn 1 
and when a boy starts to focus on other things then the feeling of girl starts to increase with time according to eqn 2 

[ second possibily ]
Means when a boy keeps flirts with girl and when boy knows girl is interested in her then boy gets keen then the love of girl decreases with time according to eqn 1 
and when a boy starts to focus on other things or seems little uninterested then the feeling of girl starts to increase with time according to eqn 2 

I EDITED THE DESCRIPTION MULTIPLE TIME, I MIGHT BE WRONG [ do your own research ]
