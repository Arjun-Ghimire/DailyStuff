At burger house eating tasty food alone😂
Learning to vibe alone ❤️ 

// 6:48 Pm
Lol burger house cheated me 😂
I ate food of around 400 rs. And they told my bill
Is rs. 790 and at that time I didn't calculate anything or didn't think
Any thing and just paid them the bill and when I get out I though why it was high
Then I calculated then I noticed it should be around 400 rs not 790 lol 😂
I just eat momo, sandwich and a 1 piece cfc and the total price is around 400 only.

Actually Its my mistake that I didn't carefully look before paying 😐🙃

I will take care about this things in future!

wohooo I comeup with an awesome idea!!!!!
The thing I am doing on github I will make a platform to do this stuff haha 😂

This is my college project and I will work on this project! 
This is the project details ----

"""  A place where you can post or keep a track of your
daily activities, not a social media platform, its more
likely a place where you keep track of your 
stuff and peoples who wants to see your daily stuff
can follow you. Its a place like social media but with no 
distractions, peoples can follow you but they can't
comment, they can't text you or message you! You
can share your stuff and expect no likes,comments,
or text messages! Means no distraction. If you post
a status then you will be able to see only views 
count how many viewed your status and you can't
also view who viewed your status. This stuff is being
made to socially connect each other causing no any 
distraction to yourself! """"


hehe its a cool project seriously!!@!!
