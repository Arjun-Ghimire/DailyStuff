Getting ready for exam :)

Be sufficient

Today morning at college I got to know that exam result of 1st semister is published
And as expected I failed on 2 subjects Physics and PST
I didn't expected to fail at pst but... god knows..

I got good grades on my technical subjects i.e FIT and C programming. I Got A- which is fine cuz I never submit assignment so I had poor marks on my internal evaluation marks..


I feel super guilty for not studying a bit in 1st sem.
I should have studied I feel soo shame!
