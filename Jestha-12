Today morning at college I got to know that exam result of 1st semister is published
And as expected I failed on 2 subjects Physics and PST
I didn't expected to fail at pst but... god knows..

I got good grades on my technical subjects i.e FIT and C programming. I Got A- which is fine cuz I never submit assignment so I had poor marks on my internal evaluation marks..


I feel super guilty for not studying a bit in 1st sem.
I should have studied I feel soo shame!

Learning to vibe alone is very important in life (according to me)
No one will be with you forever.. mostly if you think someone is with you then most probably that person is with you 
Because of their own personal benefits only.. The more quicker you understand the better it is.!

And I didn't told my family that result has come and I failed🤣🤣
Well this is not new thing for me, I never used to tell on my college life aswell at internal exams*

But this time final exam shit and I failed lol! 
Actually I feel bad for not studying any thing in first sem!
But yeah now I am already on track so I will do amazing things in future... lots of success on line
