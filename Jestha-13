In life everyone does mistake, 
you should learn from your mistake not from your success.

In life you should not think too much about your mistake, if you see a person did a mistake and you judge that person as a bad person or a worst person or whatever
then you are wrong, you can't judge a person with some mistakes or galti that person had made
