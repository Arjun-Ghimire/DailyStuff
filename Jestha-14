I just laught at myself when I remember I used to attend to meettings during my final exam in 1st sem lol, I did no focus that time, thats okay :)
But now I have known myself and I pretty much know what I do, I do best at that :)

In past I was always a looser, I mean most often.
But now I am learning to always win :)
And this change is really important for me! 
I don't call myself I always win or nothing like that, but I give my best to always win.
Previously I didn't had this gut feeling or like I had less feeling like how can I be the only best out of soo many peoples,
But now I feel Like I know how to handle everything!

I just feel like I am the best and I know how to do best! and give my best!
