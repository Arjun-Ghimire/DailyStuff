From tommrow I am starting a challenge video for npspark! 
This is going to be soooo  coooolllll 
The name of my challenge is " Surviving 15 days with rs.15 "
This idea kind of came to my head yesterday.

In this challenge I will spend 0 rs. and at the end of the day I will donate 1 rs. every day to charity and I will do this
continously for 15 days. I will have rs.15 coin in my purse and if incase I lost any of my coin then I have to add additional days to the 15 days 

omg this is going to be very insane and cool ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£
