# My life is open source* 
This line kinda came to my head just now (11 baishak 4:59 pm) so I updated this line.
I believe I might be the only guy doing this at github lol

# DailyStuff
I update my stupid daily stuff here, A simple repo for a track of what I am doing, DON'T READ THE DATES ITS ONLY FOR ME!
If you are reading this then I have nothing to say* I warned you before* My nerdy stupid stuff will bore you 

# Why this repository ?
I like sharing what I do, since I am not on social media so you don't forcefully need to see my story or posts.
If anyone wants an update on what I am doing then just see this repo where I have track of my everyday activities

# Why its not private ?
I wanted to make this repo private and only for me but if I die tommrow no-one will know what I did in my entire life,
Thats why I thought lets make this public and if anyone wants an update on me they can simply view this repo
