At temple thinking about my self ğŸ˜‚ My day starts with thinking about codes 
And ends with thinking about codes even my dream are now " How can I solve this problem with code "
This is cool, this is what I wanted :)

Staying away from friend and eveyone and just working on yourself to improve yourself is a great feeling :)
